## How to use

### Crafting a key
Crafting only takes 1 iron ingot, and 1 stick.

### Locking a container
In order to lock a container, it's simple. Hold the key, look at a container, and execute `/addlock`. This will add a lock to the container (if no errors occur)

### Creating spare keys
In Locksmith, you can also create spare keys. These can serve as either backups, or can be given to teammates! Just create a key like regular, but, instead of using `/addlock`, use `/setspare`. You can add an infinite amount of spare keys to a locked container.
